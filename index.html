	<h2>Beside You</h2>
	<h4>By James Blunt</h4>
	<p>I heard there's a song that God only knows
	And it's keeping me dancing (Dancing, dancing)
	Nobody here knows how the melody goes
	But it's keeping me dancing (Dancing, dancing)
	(Beside you)</p>
	<p>Oh, Lord, here I go<br>
	I get the highs, but why the lows?<br>
	Set me up with all these souls<br>
	And I watch them fall like dominoes<br>
	Too long I been on my feet<br>
	Need more time, but it don't come cheap<br>
	Some day I'll be on my knees<br>
	And I pray my heart don't miss a beat</p>
	<p>But here I am and I feel that rhythm<br>
	Miss the lifeline that I've been given<br>
	And all these colours in my head<br>
	And I ask myself, "Is it over yet?"</p>
	<p>I heard there's a song that God only knows<br>
	And it's keeping me dancing<br>
	Nobody here knows how the melody goes<br>
	But it's keeping me dancing beside you</p>
